<p>Two years ago Kevin Cutler wanted to end his life.
</p>
<p>“I went through a lot of stuff. The biggest blow was I had back surgery and that kind of hindered me from wrestling and doing anything,” Cutler, 21, said. “During my recovery process I was depressed and I was on the verge of calling it quits.”
</p>
<p>Cutler is one of about 20 wrestlers, who gather every first Saturday of the month at Daro’s Extreme Fitness in the Bronx to fight each other in the ring. Every wrestler has their own reason for joining. Cutler became part of the group because it reminded him of his grandmother who passed away.
</p>
<p>“I’d be in her bedroom and her and I would be sitting cuddled up and her little Chihuahua would jump on the bed and we’d all sit there and watch wrestling,” Cutler said. “I would always wait for The Undertaker’s music to hit and just lose my mind as a kid, but I would always be so fascinated with how his presence alone just struck fear into people.”
</p>
<p>Cutler’s wrestling influences are mostly from the WWE, an American entertainment company that deals with professional wrestling, but when he’s in the ring he fights against people from different wrestling backgrounds, including Lucha Libre.
</p>
<p>Heather Levi, an associate professor of anthropology at Temple University, said Lucha Libre originated in Mexico during the 1930s.
</p>
<p>"It's the Mexican version of professional wrestling in which there's a lot more emphasis on agility and speed and costuming than the U.S. version," said Levi. "It became a profound part of urban working class Mexican culture.”
</p>
<p>Francisco Segundo is a luchador, or wrestler, and sometimes fights alongside Cutler. Segundo founded the gym where the wrestling matches take place every month. He moved to the Bronx in 2001 from the Dominican Republic, where he wrestled for more than 30 years as Bronco International. When Segundo arrived in the Bronx he realized there was no Lucha Libre scene in the area, so he created the Bronx Wrestling Federation in 2010.
</p>
<p>“It was difficult because when I started there was only about seven or eight wrestlers,” Segundo said in Spanish. “I didn’t have a facility, I didn’t have the tools, I needed everything. I only had a good idea.”
<p/>
<p>Cutler admires Segundo’s long career and wants the same for himself, but Cutler’s dream almost ended when he was 19.
</p>
<p>Cutler was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1, a condition where non-cancerous tumors grow along nerves in the brain, skin and other parts of the body. He had tumors along his spinal cord and they pushed against his spinal column. Cutler had to undergo spinal surgery because he was at risk of being paralyzed if the tumors continued to push against his spinal cord.
</p>
<p>The possibility of not being able to walk and not returning to the ring scared Cutler. But surgery wasn’t the most difficult part for him, it was the recovery process.
</p>
<p>“Not being able to move for about three days and then struggling to relearn to walk, to move my body and get used to it, it really puts you in a state of mind of, “Will I be like this forever,”” Cutler said.
</p>
<p>Cutler’s family was scared to let him out of the house after his surgery because they worried he’d hurt himself and the recovery would take longer. Cutler felt trapped at home and when his family would leave the house, so would he. In secret.
</p>
<p>“I’d struggle. I’d get up and I’d just leave the house and I’d just walk,” Cutler said. “I’d walk far distances. I’d walk short distances. I just had to get out of the house because when you’re trapped in an area and you feel helpless, it messes with you a lot.”
</p>
<p>Cutler would leave his house to destress and build the strength to train himself to walk at full speed again and live a normal life.
</p>
<p>Doctors told Cutler recovery would take about three months, but with his determination he was able to get back in the ring in less than two months.
</p>
<p>Cutler thinks about his surgery and recovery process pretty often, especially when preparing for upcoming matches. It reminds him to appreciate everything because he realized how quickly something can be taken away.
